# Prueba_05

Time 4 hours

Create an API REST that contains three public endpoints only accessible after being authenticated with 42 Oauth2.

- 1st Endpoint : Retrieve all personal information of the user
- 2nd Endpoint : Retrieve all skills and expertises of the user
- 3rd Endpoint : School record of a student (an extraction of all personal projects marks of the user)

This API will have to be up only with one command line.

- **Free - Stack (PS: Frameworks are allowed)**

Your web application will have to consume only data from 42API.

Your final work will need to be available on a GITHUB public repository, you will have to send an email to signal@42urduliz.com with your login as subject email and your URL repository as body message.

We need to receive this email before your end of exam session.

Good luck ðŸ˜Ž
